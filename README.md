Simple notification creator

Why not working?

Solution #1 - Haven't downloaded python or requirements

1. Download python 3.11 installer (from 

https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.1/python-3.11.1-amd64.exe

)
2. Check the box that says "Add python 3.11 to PATH"
3. Proceed with the installation
4. After you installed python 3.11, run the setup.bat file.
5. Enjoy notif creator! (For stupid, run the Notif creator.py with Python 3.11)

Solution #2 - Didn't place icon.ico and Notif creator.py together

1. Place notif creator.py and icon.ico in the same folder
